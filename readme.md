### Real time snow cover plugin for X-Plane 12
Currently, when using real weather in X-Plane 12, the snow only accumulates when it's snowing. 
This plugin uses the Open meteo api https://open-meteo.com/ 
to get real time snow depth data and injects it into X-Plane 12 using the 'sim/private/controls/wxr/snow_now' dataref.
